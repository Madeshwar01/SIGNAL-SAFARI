A real-time mapping system dynamically shows cellular network coverage on a college campus, using the Vvm501 ESP32 4G LTE SIM A7672 Module to measure signal strength from major cellular operators. Data on upload/download speeds and latency are broadcast to a MQTT cluster via MQTT hive websocket and shown on a dynamic webpage powered by webflow for real-time updates.
Signal Safari embarks on a comprehensive expedition to meticulously gauge the signal 
integrity emanating from the principal cellular operator, Airtel, spanning the vast terrain of 
the CEG campus. Our ambitious project is anchored on the creation of a dynamic, automated 
cartographic framework that intricately maps out the ever-fluctuating network coverage in 
real-time. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, we aspire to provide a visually immersive 
experience that illuminates the nuanced variations in signal strength, thus fostering a profound 
understanding of network performance for the diverse community of students and 
administrators traversing the campus landscape. Through this endeavour, we endeavour to 
empower stakeholders with actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making and 
enhancing the overall connectivity experience within the campus ecosystem
